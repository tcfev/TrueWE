# "Open Science: An Exploration of Updatable Science and Raw Document Sharing"

# Introduction:
The advancement of science is a continuous process, and with the increasing rate of technological advancements, it's crucial to keep pace with the latest research and discoveries. The traditional approach of science publishing has limitations, including the lengthy review process, lack of transparency, and the potential for mistakes to go unnoticed. The emergence of Open Science provides a new avenue to overcome these limitations. Open Science emphasizes the importance of collaboration, transparency, and accessibility in scientific research.

In this research proposal, we aim to explore the potential of updatable science and raw document sharing in the field of Open Science. The significance of this study lies in the potential to improve the speed, accuracy, and transparency of scientific research, by addressing the limitations of the current scientific publishing process. We believe that updatable science, combined with raw document sharing, has the potential to revolutionize the way science is conducted and published.

# Research Objective:
The objective of this research is to explore the concept of updatable science and its potential impact on scientific research. Additionally, we aim to examine the challenges and benefits of implementing raw document sharing in Open Science.

# Methodology:
The research will involve a literature review of existing literature on Open Science, updatable science, and raw document sharing. This review will provide an understanding of the current state of Open Science and the existing challenges and opportunities.


# Timeline and Budget:
The timeline for this research project is estimated to be 306 months, with a budget of 1,000â‚³.. The budget will be used to cover the cost of literature review

# Outcome
A solid research plan proposal for updatable science
